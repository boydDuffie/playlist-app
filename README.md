## Making music discovery on Spotify less lame.
---

##### What is this?
This project is a webapp created using the MERN Stack that aims to make music discovery more personal and fun.
Things this app can do: 
- Categorize music by subjective attributes:
  - Color
  - Texture
  - Emotion
- Permit users to curate playlists and create curator profiles. Think Myspace, but purely for playlists. 
- Use community input to effectively match music to their most fitting attributes. 


##### How do I contribute?
Pick an issue, and contact Boyd to start working! You can find resources down below. 
Keep in mind other people will be reading and using your code, so it's *very* important that you comment 
and keep your code tidy. Always try to look at what you're writing and pretend someone who knew nothing about it
had to work with it.
